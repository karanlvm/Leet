"""
Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "IceCreAm"

Output: "AceCreIm"

Explanation:

The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: "leotcede"

The idea is to use two pointers to point to the start of the string and the end of the string and keep swapping the vowels
